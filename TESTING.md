## Code Validation

### Javascript JSHint 
All JavaScript code was analysed with [JSHint](https://jshint.com)

** Some JS files may appear to contain undefined variables. This is because those are created by Django in different templates when views are rendered. **

### CSS Validation

** Important note about CSS in this project **

- For the Cruise Manager system CSS styling was achieved using the [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework and tooling. Therefore the files ** input.css ** and ** style.css ** has been automatically been generated by Tailwind so I have not run them through the validator.
- For the customer (non-staff) facing sections of this project I have used custom vanilla CSS. I have validated all of those files and recorded the results below.

CSS files were validated with the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/)
