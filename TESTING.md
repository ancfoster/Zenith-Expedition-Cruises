## Code Validation

### Javascript JSHint 
All JavaScript code was analysed with [JSHint](https://jshint.com)

** Some JS files may appear to contain undefined variables. This is because those are created by Django in different templates when views are rendered. **

### CSS Validation

**Important note about CSS in this project**

- For the Cruise Manager system CSS styling was achieved using the [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework and tooling. Therefore the files **input.css** and **style.css** has been automatically been generated by Tailwind so I have not run them through the validator.
- For the customer (non-staff) facing sections of this project I have used custom vanilla CSS. I have validated all of those files and recorded the results below.

CSS files were validated with the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/)

## Responsiveness

- Each page was tested using Google Chrome's developer tools where it is possible to mimick the screen size and other settings for different mobile and desktop devices. 
- Each page was tested with the Google Chrome settings for iPhone XR, iPad Air tablet and a MDI display laptop with a 1080p resolution.


## Manual Testing

Tests were carried to test all aspects of cruise manager admin and customer functionality.

- Example with experience page:
